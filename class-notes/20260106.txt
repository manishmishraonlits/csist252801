3. Iterative Flow

Write an algorithm to print "C was developed by Dennis Ritche in 1972" 500000 times.

Step 1: Start
Step 2:	Repeat Step 3 For i = 1 To 5000000
Step 3: Print "C was developed by Dennis Ritche in 1972"
	[End of loop]
Step 4: Stop

WAP to print all the prime numbers between 1 and 5000000.
WAP to read an integer and find whether  is prime or not.
WAP to read an integer and find its factorial.

5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120	1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5
13!
