Write an algorithm to read an integer and display its factors.
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read n
Step 3: Repeat step 4 for i = 1 to n
Step 4: 	If(n%i==0)

Write an algorithm to read an integer and count its factors.
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Set count=0
Step 3: Read n
Step 4: Repeat step 5 for i = 1 to n
Step 5: 	If(n%i==0)
			count = count + 1
		[End of if statement]
	[End of loop]
Step 6: Print count
Step 7: Stop

Characteristics of a good program:
- Efficient
- Robust
- Readable
- Maintainable
- Correct

count = 0;
printf("Enter an integer: ");
scanf("%d", &n);
for(i=1; i<=n; i++)
{
	if(n%i==0)
	{
		count++;
	}	
}
printf("%d has %d factors.", n, count);
